Strategy 1: Find the guard that has the most minutes asleep. 
What minute does that guard spend asleep the most?

In the example above, Guard #10 spent the most minutes asleep, a total of 50 minutes (20+25+5), 
while Guard #99 only slept for a total of 30 minutes (10+10+10). Guard #10 was asleep most 
during minute 24 (on two days, whereas any other minute the guard was asleep was only seen on one day).

While this example listed the entries in chronological order, your entries are in the order you found them. 
You'll need to organize them before they can be analyzed.
